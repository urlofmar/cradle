# Messages
This section aims to give an overview of the messages exchanged between CRADLE and its clients.

`copy_calculation`         | `copy_calculation_response`     | Thinknode  |

There's also the `error` response that is sent instead of the normal one, if an error
occurs interpreting or processing the request.

Statuses:

* CRADLE: will stay useful
* Testing: used for testing, not appropriate for normal CRADLE clients
* Astroid: Astroid-specific, candidate for removal
* Thinknode: Thinknode-specific, candidate for removal

It should be noted that all these messages are synchronous: CRADLE will send
the response only when the data is available. Thinknode exposes an asynchronous interface,
but where necessary CRADLE will enter a polling loop, querying Thinknode until
the operation has finished.
